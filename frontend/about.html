        <p class="nt-section-lead">
          NEWS THING is built for people who hate awkward small talk but still want to sound awake and plugged in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is simple: take real headlines and social trends, summarize them, add a safety level, and wrap them
          into swipeable cards that come with natural icebreakers. Instead of scrolling through ten different apps
          before an event, you open one page and get a stack of fresh, easy-to-use topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          NEWS THING is not a chatbot, not a script generator, and not a full news app. It’s a small-talk helper that
          sits between the news world and the social world and gives you a gentle nudge in the right direction.

        <h2 class="nt-section-title">How we choose sources</h2>
        <p>
          We pull stories from public, reputable outlets. Every country has its own curated list so that Saudi Arabia
          doesn’t see the same feed as the United States, and the United Kingdom doesn’t see the same categories as
          the UAE.
        </p>
        <p>
          These sources include global wires and local outlets in news, finance, sports, fashion, and culture. We do
          not invent news. We simply repackage what’s already trending into a clean card with a conversation angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the internet changes constantly, stories may appear, change, or disappear quickly. Anything important
          should always be double-checked at the original source.
        </p>

        <h2 class="nt-section-title">How safety levels work</h2>
        <p>
          Not every headline is equally easy to talk about. Some are light and harmless. Others can turn intense very
          fast. NEWS THING adds a simple 1–3 safety level to each card:
        </p>
        <ul class="nt-bullet-list">
          <li><strong>1 – Green:</strong> friendly, light topics like events, fashion, trends, equestrian, and everyday stories.</li>
          <li><strong>2 – Orange:</strong> normal news like business, AI, royal family, sports, and most politics.</li>
          <li><strong>3 – Red:</strong> sensitive or heavy topics that need more care and context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Behind the scenes, categories and keywords help estimate how intense a story might feel in conversation. Very
          dark or traumatic stories are filtered out so you are not ambushed with content that doesn’t belong in casual
          small talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re still in control. A green card is usually safe anywhere. Orange may be good if you already know the
          person a bit. Red is a sign to read the room and only go there if it genuinely feels right.
        </p>

        <h2 class="nt-section-title">Why we warn about AI topics</h2>
        <p>
          AI is one of the most polarizing topics right now. Some people are excited about it, some are tired of
          hearing about it, and some are worried about their future. NEWS THING adds a small hint when a card is
          clearly AI-related so you remember to approach it gently and not assume everyone thinks the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can still talk about AI if you want to, but a short heads-up gives you a chance to choose your words and
          your moment more carefully.

        <h2 class="nt-section-title">FAQ</h2>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>Is NEWS THING a chatbot?</h3>
          <p>
            No. NEWS THING doesn’t talk to other people for you and doesn’t pretend to be you. It just gives you a
            stack of conversation ideas based on what’s happening in the world right now.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>Do you store what I say?</h3>
          <p>
            NEWS THING focuses on headlines and topics. It doesn’t need your actual conversations. In the future,
            anonymous usage analytics may be used to improve the product, but the goal is to keep things simple and
            respectful.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>Is the news always accurate?</h3>
          <p>
            We rely on external news and trend sources. They can update or change at any time. NEWS THING is a helper
            for casual conversation, not a fact-checking tool. Always double-check anything important at the original
            source.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>Is this safe for teenagers?</h3>
          <p>
            The safety levels are designed with younger users in mind. Green and orange topics are generally safe for
            school and family contexts. Red topics can be more sensitive, and very heavy stories are filtered out.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>Can I use NEWS THING for dating or meeting new people?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. The cards are meant to work with strangers as well as friends, as long as you respect boundaries and
            basic common sense. Light, green topics are usually the best starting point.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>Where does the social stack come from?</h3>
          <p>
            The social stack uses similar sources to the news stack, but focuses on softer stories, lifestyle angles,
            entertainment, and trends. It’s designed to feel more like “what people are chatting about” rather than
            headlines.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>How often are topics updated?</h3>
          <p>
            NEWS THING reads from feeds that update regularly. Some categories move quickly (like trending stories),
            and others change more slowly (like long-term finance or education). The goal is to keep you close to what
            people are actually noticing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="nt-faq">
          <h3>Do you show ads?</h3>
          <p>
            The design includes space for future ads so that NEWS THING can remain free to use. When ads are added,
            they will be placed away from the core card content to keep the experience focused.
